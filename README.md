# pands-problem-sheet
This is the readme file for the pands problem sheet
This serves to introduce each weekly task and explain how to operate them
I will also explain some of the obstacles faced along the way and the integral references used.


Week 01- helloworld.py
Running the program: Run in the terminal. The program should then show 'Helloworld.py'.
Notes: This is an introductory assignment used to become accustomed to the interface IDE and also be able to use Github.
References: Lecture notes.

Week 02- bank.py
Running the program: This program takes number in cents and converts them to euro with a decimel place. Once you run the program you will be promted to enter two numbers.
Notes: My first attempt on creating this program used floats but my second attempt used the int function, as per the instructions of the task, to achieve the same result.

Week 03- account.py
Running the program: When running this program you need to enter a ten digit number into the terminal and the program will return the number with the first 6 digits replaced with an X.
Notes: I made a number of different attempts at this code but once I realised i could just take away the first six numbers and add 6 xs, then it became significantly easier.

Week 04- collatz.py
Running the program: asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation: At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one. Have the program end if the current value is one.
Notes: keeping this code neat was a challenge as their are many different processes within the assignment.

Week 05- weekday.py
Running the program: Run the program and it will print 'Yes, unfortunately today is a weekday.' if it is a weekday and 'It is the weekend, yay!' if it is a weekend. 
Notes: I altered an already available code to get the result. I first began by trying to define each number as a day i.e. 1 = Monday. Then If it was monday -friday for it to say itt was a weekday. I discovered it was much more compact and easier to do if left as an integer.

Week 06- sqrt.py
Running the program:
Notes: This program uses newtons method to achieve the square root. I found a code to use as base and then applied my learning to achieve the task.
References: Code used as skeleton for this assignment: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55232484/newtons-method-for-approximating-square-roots

Week 07- Es.py
Running the program: This program runs in the command line and tells the user how many letter 'Es' a text file has. To use type the following code into the command line: python es.py HOD.txt 
Notes: This assignment was difficult as finding the file in the directory created a substantial problem. Once this was overcome, the project worked perfectly.

Week 08- plot.py
Running the program:Aa program that prints a histogram based on:a histogram of a normal distribution of a 1000 values with a mean of 5 and standard deviation of 2, and a plot of the function  h(x)=x3 in the range [0, 10]. Once the program is ran a histogram should appear featuring the parameters mentioned. 
Notes: Using the lecture notes as reference this program came to life. Further revision and study on standard deviation was needed to complete the task.

Overall comments:
The problems every week have served me well on my journey through this course. The problem solving element of this was very enjoyable and has helped my confidence grow throughout.
